operation in a future development framework will take full advantage of trade as a vehicle for achieving sound development objectives and technology transfer . xxmaj this may require some criteria that differentiate trade based on its ability to advance the cause of sustainable development in general or sdgs in particular . xxmaj even though this is not happening yet , the significance of trade in promoting sustainable development is recognized by several countries ( xxmaj china and xxmaj india ) . xxmaj conflicts need to be resolved between xxmaj world xxmaj trade xxmaj organization rules on non -
